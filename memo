1. The PC should append a dead loop at the end of the instruction for each axis.

2. The MCU's timer frequency = 16MHz (T=62.5ns). There is a 1/8 scaler on the timer of the MCU.
   That been said, the motor's frequency is 2MHz.
  
3. The delay time for each step should be greater than 1000:
   The MCU need time to process the instruction. The motor need time to response.

4. Max nest level = 14

5. Last 8 bytes in the query represent the start loaction of the query for each axis. Each axies uses 2 bytes (16-bit int).

Instruction:
PC > 00000000: Enter program mode.
               The PC should send a 4k byte query to the controller next, and then the controller will return a checksum.
	       If checksum is not correct, re-enter the program mode and re-send the query.

PC > xxxxxxxx:	Program instruction, length = x * 256 byte. Max instruction length: 1024 words (4096 bytes), Xmax = 16.
		Instruction [1:0]: --- of Axis-1.
		Instruction [3:2]: --- of Axis-2.
		Instruction [5:4]: --- of Axis-3.
		Instruction [7:6]: --- of Axis-4.
		Return: the command you just send.
			----: 00: No action
			      01: 1 step forward
			      10: 1 step backward
			      11: Star/stop timer for this axis (pause/resume query)
