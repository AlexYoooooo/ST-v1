1. The PC should append a dead loop at the end of the instruction for each axis.

2. The MCU's timer frequency = 2MHz (T=0.5us). The delay time for each step should be greater than 2000:
  The MCU need time to process the instruction.
  The motor need time to response.

3. The front end software should reset all the axis to the init point before use.

4. Max nest level = 14
